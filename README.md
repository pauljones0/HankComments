# HankComments

Hank Green had a video, where he asked his viewers to recommend books, movies, TV shows, and video games, that they thought were calming.
I iterated through all the comments, stored them in a txt file, then used GPT 3.5 Turbo to parse the comments into a list of recommendations, grouped by category.
I then used GPT 4 Code Interpreter to analyze the recommendations, and create visualizations for each category.

## Animated Visualization
Here's an animated overview of the top recommendations across all categories:
