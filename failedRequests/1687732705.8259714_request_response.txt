All your friends, families, and us viewers online understand. \nbetter not pull a techno\nHank, you and John have made my life so much better over the past few years just by being yourselves. You've done such great things for humanity and all of us. It's heart-wrenching that there really is no fairness when it comes to doling out something like this. But I'm pulling for you and I'm sure we all are too. Get better \nAbzu - is a nice experience video game where there is not much to do but relax and enjoy the view and the mechanics. Mario Party Superstars - for a fun time with friends Advance Wars - great strategy game for a mind like yours. Untitled Goose Game - A silly fun game! Donut county - same as above\nThere is a UK show on YouTube called Taskmaster. There are like 15 series/seasons of it, it'd hilarious and amazing and each series is like 8 hours of content. It's a GameSpot where the task always changes and comedians, mainly, compete to do the task the best. Highly recommend!!!\n50/50 because I loved the friendship in it.\nYou got this, my dude, I hope you get through ok! That shit sucks; it can be demoralizing. :( I believe in you, man!\nOh, yeah, I've experienced American health care when it gets efficient. I was a 55 year old man, walked into a hospital with complaints of some chest pains, and I swear it took them 30 seconds to get me half naked and lying on a bed with wires and needles coming out of me all over the place. It was terrifyingly effective. I'm a 66 year old man now, which is a good sign.\nI am glad they're taking it seriously, also. Remember: You are more than enough just by being. We all love you, Hank! You will get through this Edit: I remember watching Kim's Convenience really made me laugh and helped me get through depression\nSo sorry to hear this. Hope u get well soon\nTake heart prayers go out to you just remember it is very curable\nI cry at EVERYTHING, so this list was hard to make, but I am also very confident that these are safe, fun picks. Video Game Rec: A Little to the Left Books/Audiobooks: Kiki's Delivery Service The Wisteria Society of Lady Scoundrels (flying houses in regency england. The most dumb fun thing I've ever read.) Legends and Lattes The Ruthless Lady's Guide to Wizardry Manga/Graphic Novels The Savior's Book Cafe Story in Another World It's time for your cozy fantasy era. Go forth! In all seriousness, I'm sending you all the good vibes and I'm glad you're allowing yourself space to do what is best for you. This community loves you, and we're happy that you are taking care of yourself. \nGreat British Baking Show is feel good and fluffy. Also, Floor is Lava and nailed It. Be well, sir. Thinking of you.\nThe Big Lebowski, Liar Liar, The Princess Bride, The Goonies. One day at a time, Hank. DFTBA\nSending love, Hank. You of all people have got this\nWishing you the best, Hank\nhank! wishing you the very best! recommending.. tears of the kingdom! a little on the heavier side, but zelda is a joy! and gilmore girls! very long, good, relaxing time\nHank, you will always be fun, goofy, science guy. That is who you are. You dont have to be defined by things you go through. Feel all of the feelings, and escape/distract when you need to. My favorite escapism watches are The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy (2005), and The Color of Magic (2008).\nI hope you pull through man. Take care of yourself meanwhile\n<3 sending love been watching you since the dawn of youtube and you're an absolute idol\nGet better \nYou're the man Hank!
