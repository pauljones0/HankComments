        "content": "One of our favorite no-cry shows is Tasting History With Max Miller (Youtube). More of a history show than cooking show, always funny and interesting. Schitts Creek lives up to the hype, and nothing tragic happens to anyone, ever.\nYour amazing Hank and educate me so much on cool topics. Your like a super cool teacherman!!!sending\nThe thing about being terminally ill that gets me is... Nothing changes, really. You're still expected to go to work, to provide, to comfort people... Life just goes on, yours will just end a lot sooner and... People will remember you, for a while. But life goes for them too, you'll end up as a distant memory, a face you can't even remember anymore.\nHighly recommend Freakazoid for all weird and happy vibes with no stress or sadness. Gets me through every trough. Best wishes.\nThere's this great YouTube channel called scishow that i watch when I need something happy and unemotional! and Crash course everything! You are a light in the darkness and it will be an interesting ride. I can't wait to see how much you can learn and share throughout this process. I know you will find out interesting things along the way!\nYou're still the cool science guy. People are multifaceted and everything in life can connect back to science. Happy, bland media is my specialty as someone who has long struggled with anxiety and depression. Some favorites... Games - Katamari Damacy, Stardew Valley, The Sims, Sun Haven, almost anything Nintendo TV - Schitt's Creek, What We Do In The Shadows, Black Books, Monty Python, Jeeves and Wooster\nHank, I've been watching you all over online since middle school, and out of everyone, you have been so educational, funny, and one of those small things in your life that has always brightened my day. You have done so much for the world, so much for the future generations of science lovers, and we all thank you so much! But this is definitely the time to focus on you. If you love making videos and educating people, then you need to get better so you can do what you love for decades to come. We can all wait and watch what you've already given us, your life is more important. Thank you Hank Green, for everything you've done for humanity, and for what you've done for me. I hope you get better, I hope you're surrounded by the ones you love, and I hope at some point you can get back to living the life you want to live. From my house to yours\nTerrible news bro I am really sorry. Glad to hear you are on the fast track for treatment and you seem in really good spirit for someone who just received such life changing news. I put that down to your intelligence. I wish you a speedy treatment and all the best! Keep talking, keep sharing and don't let this get you down!!\nI went through a very challenging year with my health last year, and I know it might seem silly, but Bob's Burgers brought me a tremendous amount of joy and comfort, and there's plenty of seasons to get wrapped up in. Stay strong!\n\"an identity was thrust upon me\" I never considered this, but I get exactly what you mean. from one goofy science guy to the next, much love <3. thank you for being you.\nBeverly Hillbillies - it's on YouTube. I'm a big fan and I also know (second hand) what you are going to be dealing with on the chemo - you get lots of rest and I'll look forward to seeing you on and off with progress reports and we'll all be looking forward to your jokes and insights and super duper recovery!!! Love that you are pretty up front with what not to do \"to help\". Another funny TV show was Sordid Lives - there's a movie too but the TV show was better.\nIve been watching you since my 5th grade year and I just graduated high school. Youve had such a big impact on so many lives were all here for you good luck\nHes got good Hodgkins\nI recommend The worst witch. It 100% hit the no negative vibes criteria when i was in a similar spot."
