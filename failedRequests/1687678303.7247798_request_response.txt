        "content": "Dear Hank, You don't know me, but I decided to take this opportunity to pop out of the woodwork to let you know why something you said in this video bothered me. When you said that this illness is \"an identity that [you're] having thrust upon [you],\" you invoked a way of speaking about identity that I've noticed has become prevalent on the left side of the political spectrum over the past several years. A person's identity is what makes them a distinct entity, and yet people have been using the word to mean a demographic to which a person belongs. When you take out your ID card, it does not simply say \"male\" on it. It does not say \"Hodgkin's lymphoma\" on it. It doesn't even say \"white, cisgender male with Hodgkin's lymphoma\" on it. It says \"Hank Green\" on it. I recognize that, for some people, the demographic(s) to which they belong are an important part of who they are, but it's hard for me to believe that that's all they are, and I often feel that I'm being pressured to participate in stereotyping people by defining them that way. I worry a lot more now than ever before that people are stereotyping me that way. I want people to understand that the most important things about me are my beliefs, my values, and the choices I make, not the things I can't (and shouldn't necessarily want) to change about myself, like my race. I believe in self-determination, by which I mean that a person gets to decide how to define themselves. You get to decide how to assign meaning to your own life. If you want to be known as fun-and-goofy-science-guy, that's who you are. I know that our experiences influence who we are, so there may be times when you feel like struggling-with-anxiety-cancer-guy has eclipsed fun-and-goofy-science-guy, but that doesn't mean you have to define yourself by it. We know what's brought you joy in the past, and we know why it's been a joy to have you in our lives. Cancer isn't going to change that which is most important about you (unless you decide it does, anyway). I also appreciate you setting boundaries about advice. I hate unsolicited advice, and I hope what I've said here hasn't come off as that. I also hope it's not too heavy. I wanted to say this because it's important to me, and I felt like you might appreciate it - or even decide to make a video about your thoughts on the subject, on a day when you feel like you can. I feel like we could be friends if we ever actually met and spent time together. You have an excellent sense of humor. I like watching your and John's videos, and I'm looking forward to continuing that in the future. Get well soon and stuff,\nSome low effort book and movie recs in no particular order Books - Murderbot series by Martha Wells Bobiverse series by Dennis e taylor Hitchhikers guide series The maid by Nita prose Starry messenger by Neil deGrasse Tyson Finlay Donovan series by Elle Cosimano Hercule Poirot books by Agatha Christie are also funny sometimes TV series - All the comedy shows you're already familiar with (New Girl, Friends, Seinfeld, The Big Bang Theory, Modern Family, Arrested Development, Brooklyn 99, etc) Santa Clarita Diet Good Girls Dead to Me The Great (season 1 is funnier) Never have I ever Space force Movies - The hangover series Ocean's 11 series The king of Staten island Murder mystery series Knives out series Begin again Easy A Most marvel movies Take care, Hank!\nAnything with Jay & Silent Bob, (except maybe dogma), Rocky & Bullwinkle cartoons, old looney tunes, Danger Mouse... for video games, maybe Minecraft, Stardew Valley, Slime Rancher (just avoid story lines).\nI recommend The guardians. It's a Russian superhero movie. They think there are emotional themes but it's so chintzy you don't feel it. Highly enjoyable\nThe Shrek movies, Dumb and Dumber, Superbad, Anchorman, Bridgerton (lots of cheese and fluffy romance), The Smurfs...lolz i am sorry, really trying but thinking of media that doesn't make you FEEL anything is hard "
