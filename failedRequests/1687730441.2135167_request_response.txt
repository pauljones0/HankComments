        "content": "Hank, you and John are such a force for good in this world and I wish you all the very best I have two recommendations for youthe first is a movie called The Big Year with Steve Martin, Jack Black, and Owen Wilson. Its about bird watchers that are competing to see the most species of birds in one year. funny and touching and makes me feel good every time I see it. The second is Best in Show with Eugene Levy, Catherine OHara, Parker Posey, Christopher Guest, and Jennifer Coolidge, among others. Its pure comedy about people competing in a fictional dog show, shot in mockumentary fashion. These are two gems that not a lot of people saw but are definitely worth checking out.\nWell wishes my guy. \n75% survive 10 years or more after diagnosis depending on which stage it was caught. You are in my prayers, brother.\nWayne's World, Encino Man, Bio Dome, Clueless. The Adventures of Pete and Pete might be too deep, but I rewatched it some months ago and it's really good. Especially \"A Hard Day's Pete\".\nBreaking bad would be a great show\nGood luck good sir. I have no doubt you will make it to the other side.\nHalt and Catch Fire is a tv show about the birth of the internet etc., meant to be good!\nShrek 1 and 2, Ratatouille, the Princess Bride, Monty Python movies!\nPlay slay the spire. Perfect game for what you asked for. Very lucky that we live in a place with access to excellent healthcare.\nI wish you nothing but success sir. Also, the phrase bald John green has been in my head for years since John used to upload soccer game videos and now I have the phrase bald hank green in my head and I dont know what to think about that but I hope we can find the comedy in it.\nGood luck Hank the world would be a darker place without you.\nI'm wishing you a speedy and successful recovery Hank. You've been there to nurture our love for science for years, and we're all eternally grateful to you and your work.\nbotw and totk are both not too heavy and offer hundreds of hours of good adventuring\nHank, take care of yourself first and foremost. We will still be here and supporting you, but your health is the most important thing right now. We  you!\nMy heart sank when I saw the title, but I have hope! You got this, Hank! Sending prayers your way \nHank - you're awesome, thanks for all the scishow content, particularly scishow psych! If books are of interest, then 'Behave' by Robert Sapolsky is great for a people-curious, polymath, scientist like you. Cheers <3\nBeen watching you since high school and now Im a pharmacist. We love you very much Hank  we are with you in this journey!!\nSending good wishes.\ncharles spearin's happiness project is a great album.\nAnyone how old this guy is and if he ever smoked? He looks younger than me.\nI just have to say good luck and I hope all goes well. Take care.\nExcited for how you are going to rock this next phase in Hank's amazing haircuts. Really sorry to hear this, but I am hoping you'll have a great recovery\nHang tough, bro. We're behind you all the way. Fight. I may not remember your face too much but your voice is memorable. It would suck not to here you anymore. Major positive vibes out to you. \nWishing you the best road to recovery <3"
