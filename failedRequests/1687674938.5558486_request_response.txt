        "content": "Movie recommendations in the reply under this comment ! Hi ! Multiple cancer graduate here. (I prefer graduate over \"survivor\"). For the last few years I've been trying to recover from a full blown A.L.L. (Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia) infiltrated in the spine and brain, a very rare form for an adult. I've got some advice, from experience : As you mentioned, we don't have much control over many things in life, and it's easy to feel even more deprived of all control in hospitals and during treatment. What helped me a lot going through the many months of treatment, pain and clean-room isolation (due to aplasia) was to be very assertive about what I did and did not want, what I accepted and what I did not. As I'm scientific minded, I required full, absolute transparency from the medical staff, they discussed treatment options *with* me, not without me : they proposed, I disposed. I also decided who could and who could not execute painful treatment acts on me after experiencing their different ways of doing things. Sorry to be selfish on this one but students will train executing a bone marrow draw on someone else, that's painful enough, I've only allowed seasoned professionals with excellent dexterity do it to me. I learned to be very affirmative about how I felt, how much pain I had, and how I tolerated the different drugs. Often doctors and hospitals are on \"autopilot\", giving a kind of standardized care, and this \"one-size fits all\" approach can make things more difficult than they need to be. It's your body, your cancer, your life, your pain and your experience with cancer and treatments, so you decide. If you don't tolerate a certain drug well, say it, discuss it openly with the staff, chances are they can give you something else, just as effective and that you may tolerate better. You don't *need* to suffer because you don't want to make a fuss. Doctors are scientists and professionals but they aren't gods. Like anti-nausea drugs for example, you may react better to your doctors' \"second choice\" drug than its standard go-to drug. Friends and family : as much as their support and presence is a massive help, it can quickly become overwhelming, exhausting and / or depressing. Some may be terrified, uneasy, over committed, fussy or completely falling apart when confronted with your situation... YOU are the patient and if it's too much, say it. They're all well intentioned and want to support you. But that can be really overwhelming sometimes. At times, my room felt like an Apple store on the morning of a new iPhone release, \"the place to be\". But it was often exhausting and at first I didn't say anything and put up a game face as i was happy to see them and afraid of hurting their feelings if I said I needed some time alone or to rest. But after a few days I said something and my friends organized an online calendar, with time slots ; they asked and perfectly understood when I wanted to be alone, rest, or needed something in particular instead of bringing stuff I didn't need, etc. So that's my advice : be affirmative, decide, take control, it's your battle, on your territory : the doctors are your strategic advisers, nurses and orderlies are your ammunition specialists and guards, friends and families are your allies and drugs are your weapons. But *you* are the commander in chief. Food and scents : With chemo you may become extremely queasy with certain smells and tastes. Ask your family and friends to avoid perfume, cologne, etc. Avoid foods that irritate your mouth's mucosa as chemo can burn it (like some cheeses, zucchini, etc.). Ask your friends and family support group for the foods you love and tolerate, don't starve yourself, even if you are disgusted by the mere idea of eating. Sometimes a very bland and simple dish is what works, you'll find what fits you. Splurge on comfort attire and accessories!"
