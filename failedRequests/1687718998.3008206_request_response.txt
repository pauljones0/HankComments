        "content": "One of the things I love most about you is youre over thinking. My husband died six months ago of something completely different than what youre talking about. He was always over thinking about everything. My advice for you, especially in life right now its not to worry about what other people think of you. Frankly, its really none of your business of what we think of you. Consider this experience as part of your journey, but not your destination. If you choose to, you can use this experience going through all of the medical procedures that youll need to do as a whole scientific experience. And when you have energy, you can reflect on those experiences I can only imagine what a book from your perspective about cancer and medical in general would be like. Just know that a lot of people have got your back and we all appreciate you and your brother. Thank you so much for the bantering something I miss most about my husband. Dont worry so much, your body is strong enough to handle this. Take this time to embrace the things that you keep forgetting to do. You would be amazed at how many small things people forget to do that make a whole world of difference.\nYoure gonna knock this out brother, youre gonna be back to science in no time\nStar Dew Valley is a fun happy little farming game that you could play with your time :) best wishes being sent to you!!\nWhen I want something mindless and feelgood, I tend to play things like slime rancher (there's a sequel to that now too if you want to check it out), also lots of pokemon, Hades, and cult of the lamb. If you're interested in silly beat-em-up games, River city girls is a pretty great series to just put your mind away and mash some buttons. Now that you have some time you could get started on an animal crossing island or a 4-player stardew valley farm?\nSpyro the Dragon and Crash Bandicoot, nothing like an old school kids platformer to get through the day. Also any fighting game, my favorite is Bloody Roar but thats hard to find, so I suggest Dead or Alive and Soul Caliber. Sometimes, you just wanna punch things virtually\nWe are all here and rooting for you. You're amazing and I am so glad it was all quick thru and figured out so fast!\nWe are all rooting for you! Hope you have a speedy and safe recovery \nVideo games! -Slay the Spire is a deck builder roguelike that is very pretty and incredibly addictive once you get familiar with it. The story is there, but difficult to come by. You don't need to know it to play. -As others have said, Stardew Valley is wonderfully adorable and comforting -Hades is difficult but rewarding both progression and story-wise. It tugs at your heartstrings a little, but it's nothing existential crisis worthy. Also Zagreus is a TALL glass of water at three in the morning Kick Lymphoma's ass, Hank. you got this \nAll the best hank.\nmy honest reaction\nI'd recommend anything by director Francis Veber (in French), Guy Ritchie, and Quentin Tarantino. Save sometime to continue to educate and entertain us too.\ni love you hank <3\nI lost my grandfather to cancer just last year, and its definitely reassuring to hear that the form of cancer you got diagnosed with is curable. Rooting for you and hoping you will get through this as swiftly as possible! You are a true inspiration Hank and I wish you the best of luck in this situation, you will kick cancers ass for sure\nKICK IT HANK!\nStar Trek 4, The Voyage Home. "
