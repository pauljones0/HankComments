        "content": "Hank we are all thinking of you from round the world. You have reached so many people through your idea and videos and we all care for you. Godspeed sir. See you on the other side of this.\nHope you get well soon enough\nHey Hank, we all are sending a whole bunch of good energy for you, okay? Be well and be safe, we love you!\nI hope and pray you get well man, I love you please be well \nLove ya Hank! You got this! For movie recommendations, I've been rewatching the Mission Impossible series in preparation for the 7th coming out this summer, and man they still go hard lol. Just fun super well made action movies about Tom Cruise being kinda nuts and doing crazy stunts! Always a good time! Also a bunch of movies from India after I fell in love with RRR (so if you haven't seen RRR watch that!) you will need to feel up to reading but they are just fantastic, a few recommendations: RRR KGF Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 Thunivu Beast Tik Tik Tik Kasari Baahubali: The Beginning Baahubali: The Conclusion Saacho Avane Srimannarayana Lagaan All incredible and just sooo much fun, can't promise you wont tear up, cause they do such a good job, but none of them very heavy. If I discover/think of anymore I'll swing by again and reply to this comment, lol.\nThis is a really really mature way to respond to a cancer diagnosis\nNo Bummer Video Games you say? let's see... These will all give you a mental workout and be incredibly distracting from whatever you are dealing with in the real world: -The Room 1,2,3,4 - Portal/Portal2 - Superliminal - The Talos Principle\nLiterally the only thing I can think of is Animal Crossing  but if you'll have so much freetime you might want something more substantial. Good luck with treatment\nHundreds of thousands are praying for you \nim not a gamer but i cannot recommend super mario galaxy on wii enough for this. played it when i was having health issues myself a few years back and truly its consuming and emotionless and COLORFUL which i swear is everything\n32 year-old stage IV cancer survivor here, I got through two horrific diagnoses despite the doctors predictions. Dont underestimate the power of humor and positivity. Listen to your gut instinct as well to the doctors. Play the cancer card when you need to, now is not the time to be a hero. Now is the time to sleep, watch movies and get out into nature. All of those trump being beholden to other people. Finally. Youre in fight or flight mode now and will be in that survival space until you get the all clear in a few months time. So above all, give yourself time to process what is happening/has happened. That might not make sense now but when you get through the worst of it, you might find yourself in a period of what-the-fuckery-just-happened-why-do-I-kinda-feel-depressed and you will need to sit with it. Thats also normal, its rarely talked about, and you will be fine. There are millions of people rooting for you. X\nI know that you know that we have absolutely no issues with you taking care of yourself. So my suggestion is to watch campy Kaiju movies from the 90s where you can both laugh at and be impressed by the effects, particularly Gamera: Gaurdian of the Universe.\nBarakamon is a good show to watch! It's fun and just a all round good feeling. I was trying to find things that just don't make me feel much when I was writing my thesis, and I think this was the one for me! Good luck, you got this.\nTake your time Hank <3\nHope everything will be ok!!!\nThere is alot wrong and I mean alot wrong with the US healthcare system, but 1 thing it does extremely right is how fast and \"efficient\" (not efficient in terms of cost) it works when it has too/when it matters.\nCartoons, Hank? Anything on Cartoon Network for example. I was going to suggest something like Steven Universe but it did make me cry. Anyways, you're "
