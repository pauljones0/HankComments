        "content": "Dude, The A&P guy will not die of cancer. Cannot possibly occur. It would be like a hose with hands to quote Hank. Good luck brother! And youre so right. When I have a patient who presents with something emergent we jump on them and before you know it theres six nurses and a doctor surrounding them all doing things. I always take just a minute and explain why we are working so fast and diligent because they tend to get scared. The norm is waiting 8 hours in the waiting room, not coming in and getting scooped up immediately. Can be disconcerting\nGood luck Hank!! You got this!\nStop copying technoblade\nHank, sadly I did not know about your content until this year . My psychology professor would play your videos for my psychology 1100 class. Im so sorry to hear about this. Youre so awesome and it made me love psychology . You have so much love and support from the community  ! Sending good vibes and hope you will get through this as smooth as possible . \nYou can do this bro, if you need to vent you got us here!\nNo pressure bro. Get better. Take care of you.\nI can't believe in this video where I'm expecting to be terrified and sad for you I'm learning scientific information about how cancers work  only you\nGame recommendations: Castle Crashers, Fez, and Terraria are games that are pretty light emotionally. I wish you the best of luck, and hope reminding you of the immortal, single-celled, dog is somehow helpful.\nAll the love to you \nHank - you are amazing and loved! Give yourself time to deal with this and you will get through this tough time !! God speed\nYou rule, Hank.\nI've really sunk into Um, Actually and Game Changers on dropout recently. The former is nerd trivia, the latter is a gameshow where no one knows the rules until they start, and they're both played for laughs first and foremost.\nHere for you bro \nCongrats\nI don't know if you will read this, but please remember how many people are cheering you on! You can do this!\nI walked around with a lymphnode the size of a pingpong ball for 1.5 years before i decided to go to the doctor. She said \"you have to go to the hospital, IMMEDIATELY\". Luckily after the biopsy they found it to be a non-hodgekin lymphoma, which got removed during a simple 20minute surgery.\nMy Political Science teacher showed me you back in 2010, when i was a freshman in HS. To me, you always felt like a Mr. Rogers. A man who just wanted the world to learn, and appreciate this crazy universe we live in. From this channel, to SciShow. I truly hope you get better Hank. There are thousands upon thousands who wish you the best. We love you Hank\nWe're here for you man!\nYou got this. You have the right attitude and spirit to beat this thing. F*** Cancer!\nI haven't had cancer but I have gone through dialysis and a kidney transplant. You can only go so far on mindless fluff. Those infusion treatments, dialysis is different but not that different, are going to be long and boring. You may want something that you can just stare at and escape from your current reality for however long it takes but you're also going to have to face the reality that you're going to be too sick to be active a lot of the rest of the time and you need stuff to keep your brain active. I cannot begin to tell you what games you'll like but find things you can replay, a lot. For media find stuff with a lot of seasons. I watched all of the Stargate franchise over the course of about three months, that's over 10 years between three shows plus some movies. I went through all of Star Trek in less than a year. I wish you the best .\nMy wife had hodgkins when she was 14, today is her 31st birthday and we have 2 beautiful kids. Remember that keeping a positive attitude is half the battle. Stay strong \nI hope this isnt like Technoblade all over again. Id be so sad\nDon't die\nVideo games: Slime Rancher and Slime Rancher 2. Casual gaming at its finest! Hope it's as good a distraction for you as it is for me."
